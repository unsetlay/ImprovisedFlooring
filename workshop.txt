description=[h1]Regarding Duplicates[/h1]
description=There are a few floor tiles that have different names but the same texture. This is intentional and not a bug. The Project Zomboid developers have reused textures a couple times while giving them unique names and files.  I've included them in the mod in case these textures change in the future.
description=
description=An example of this would be "White Mall Tiles" and "White Tiles". They are visually identical but come from two different textures in the game files.
